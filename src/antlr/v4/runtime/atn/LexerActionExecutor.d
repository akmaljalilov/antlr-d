/**
 * @uml
 * Represents an executor for a sequence of lexer actions which traversed during
 * the matching operation of a lexer rule (token).
 *
 * <p>The executor tracks position information for position-dependent lexer actions
 * efficiently, ensuring that actions appearing only at the end of the rule do
 * not cause bloating of the {@link DFA} created for the lexer.</p>
